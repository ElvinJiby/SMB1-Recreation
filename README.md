A recreation of the old NES game Super Mario Bros. 1 in Godot</br>
This is just a fun little project I worked on during summer to get my hands on game development and GDScript!</br>

Still a work-in-progress in terms of GUI and other core gameplay features.</br>
You can watch the current gameplay features (as of September 2024) through this link:
